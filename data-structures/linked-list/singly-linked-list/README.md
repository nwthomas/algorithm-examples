# SINGLY-LINKED LISTS ðŸ‘†

`Singly-Linked Lists` are a data structure that allows allocation of memory and storage space in a non-linear manner. They are different from doubly-linked lists in that you cannot traverse them in reverse.

## TYPE

A singly-linked list is a version of a list. It hold data by linking `Nodes` togehter through the use of pointers.

## DATA STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION

`Singly-Linked Lists`

By linking the pointers for next `Node` points for each `Node`, we can traverse the `Singly-Linked List` for various values and store allocation non-linear memory and storage space for data.

## SPACE AND TIME COMPLEXITY

`Singly-Linked Lists` have the following runtime complexities:

1. `O(n)` for lookup times
2. `O(n)` for searching (e.g. "traversing") it
3. `O(1)` time for insertion
4. `O(1)` time for deletion

It also has a space complexity of `O(n)`, despite the non-linearity of its nature. This space complexity is directly related to the size of values stored in the list.
