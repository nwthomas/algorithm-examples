## Purpose

This repository is a collection of data structures and assorted algorithms. Although the only languages currently used are Python and JavaScript, it will be updated in the future with new languages and new knowledge.

## What is an Algorithm?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm), "an algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks." In this respect, algorithms govern much of what computer scientists, data scientists, and machine learning scientists do, as the algorithms built define and interpret the data needing to be parsed or calculated. In this repository, the algorithms will consist of those commonly used and studied in the field of computer science.

## What is a Data Structure?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) states that "a data structure data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationship among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data." In this repository, the data structures will consist of those most common to the field of computer science (i.e. hash tables, linked lists, etc.).

## Acknowledgments

- Thanks to Aditya Bhargava, the author of [Grokking Algorithms](https://smile.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1544921791&sr=8-2&keywords=grokking+algorithm). You inspired me to learn this stuff and start documenting it for ease of later use.
- Huge thanks to [Byron Homes](https://github.com/byronholmes2018) for getting me excited about data structures and algorithms. You're awesome.
- Thanks to [Frank Faustino](https://github.com/frankfaustino) for inspiring me to create, build, and make my own data structures and algorithms repository.
